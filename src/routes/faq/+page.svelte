		<h2>What are heuristics, and why do they matter in development?</h2>
		<p>
			Heuristics are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that help simplify decision-making. While
			they're useful for quick judgments, they often lead to biases or errors. In development,
			understanding these heuristics can help you avoid common pitfalls, make better technical
			decisions, and improve your team's processes.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>How do I use the heuristics?</h2>
		<p>
			Each listing on the <a href="/heuristics#the-heuristics">heuristics page</a> has a title and a
			short blurb and â€” if it's been encountered â€” it serves as a link to a post with more detail.
			Of course, some of these biases haven't been encountered or, rather, I haven't connected the
			dots between an experience and a bias. Those are grayed-out and will <kbd>404</kbd> if you try
			to be cute.
		</p>
		<p>Each heuristic gets its own page and always follows the same structure:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>The heuristic</b> | The bias explained as simply as possible.</li>
			<li>
				<b>The real world</b> | A real-world development example of the bias and how it played out.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>The lesson</b> | The point I try to remember and use as a ðŸš© on a daily basis to

			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>How often do you update the heuristics?</h2>
		<p>
			Updates are based on my personal encounters with the heuristics during my projects. That means
			new examples or lessons might pop up whenever I connect the dots between a bias and a
			real-world experience. Thereâ€™s no set schedule, so check back occasionally for fresh content.
			You can also add me on LinkedIn where a GitHub Action will take care of shouting about my
			inadequcies since I refuse to self-promote.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h2>Can I contribute my own experiences with heuristics?</h2>
		<p>
			I mean, you <i>could</i>, but honestly, shouldn't you be busy living your own life instead of
			validating my biases? That said, if you're dying to share a story about how a bias absolutely
			wrecked your sprint planning or why you ended up naming a variable <code>stuff3</code>, feel
			free to drop me a <a href="#your_mom">note</a>. No promises I'll use it, but hey, it's your
			time.
